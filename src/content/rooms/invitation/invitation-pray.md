You’ve been in town for a few weeks now, and are starting to settle into your new life in the big city. It’s been busy, so you’ve hardly had a chance to go out or meet new people. You spend your evenings hoping that somebody will invite you to a rave. Perhaps the only option is to seek the counsel of the `rave gods`.
