You break the seal and read the contents of the letter. "Greetings party animal. Are you worthy of Platoâ€™s Rave? The trials begin at 9:00 pm at The Container Store." There is no signature, but attached to the bottom of the letter is a single piece of hard candy in a plastic wrap. Is a rave really taking place at `CONTAINER STORE`?
